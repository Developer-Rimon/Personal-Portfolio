               You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me
               a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will
               not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.

               I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even
               teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn
               advanced topics.
